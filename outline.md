# Robotics and Beyond Academy Java

## Monday: Review

### Instruction
First, have students set up a project in Eclipse and get comfortable with the
IDE's layout and some of the more useful shortcuts (Ctrl-Shift-O, Ctrl-Shift-F,
Ctrl-Space, etc.). Then, spend a bit of time reviewing the very basics of Java
to make sure everyone is on the same page:
- Input/output
- Data types
- Operators
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Methods (including the structure of the main method)

### Project
Have students create a calculator program that evaluates arithmetic equations
until the user no longer wishes to continue. The calculator must support
decimal operations. This will require using input/output, data types,
operators, conditionals, and a while loop.


## Tuesday: Data Structures

### Instruction
Introduce the concept of a data structure, relating it to the data types
students are already familiar with. Summarize the following data structures and
explain how they are similar or different from other data structures:
- Array
- Vectors
- Lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Trees
- Queues
- Stacks
- Hash Tables

### Project



## Wednesday: Algorithms and Recursion

### Instruction
Start off by introducing the concept of an
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). Some (if not all)
students will already be familiar with the idea, but make sure everyone is on
the same page as to what exactly an algorithm is. Then, move on to talk about
recursion. Again, they may already be familiar with the concept.  Then, move on
to show some of the practical applications of recursion in writing algorithms,
such as an algorithm for finding Fibonacci numbers. Lastly, make sure that
students understand the difference between an iterative algorithm (i.e. one that
uses a for loop) and a recursive algorithm.

### Project
Show students the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
game. It will be helpful to draw diagrams. Ask students to first write an
*iterative* algorithm to solve the puzzle, and then to write a *recursive*
algorithm to solve it.


## Thursday: Algorithms pt. 2

### Instruction
This lesson will focus on some important algorithms that students should be
familiar with for AP Java or college-level programming courses, including
sorting algorithms (insertion sort, bubble sort, quicksort...) and searching
algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search...). Relate these two
kinds of algorithms to the data structures learned on Tuesday and explain how
they work and the differences between each algorithm. Diagrams will be helpful.
At this point, it may be helpful to give students a very brief introduction to
[order notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) to show which
algorithms are most efficient in different cases.

### Project
Have students choose one sorting algorithm and one searching algorithm and
implement both of them first iteratively and then recursively. If time allows,
students can implement more algorithms in a similar fashion.


## Friday: Object Orientation

### Instruction
Again, depending on the students' background, they may already be familiar with
object orientation. Spend some time first exlaining the concept itself
(diagrams!) before showing the syntax. You should explain:
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### Project
This project will attempt to tie together most of the topics that have been
covered throughout the week. Students will build a Binary Search Tree class
with the following functions:
