# Academy Java Lessons

This course outline was created for
[Robotics and Beyond](https://www.roboticsandbeyond.org/) for use in their
Academy Java class, an advanced course that takes place after Java Level 1 and
Level 2. The course serves as an introduction to concepts taught in AP Computer
Science A and some introductory college-level computer science courses,
specifically Computer Science I and Data Structures. The course places an
emphasis on learning about algorithms (including insertion sort, bubble sort,
quick sort, depth-first search, breadth-first search) and data structures
(vectors, lists, maps, sets, trees, queues, stacks, hash tables), as well as
fundamental principles that can be applied beyond Java, such as
object-orientation (inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism).

The outline can be found [here](outline.md). There is also an HTML version
(with some light CSS) available for more convenient offline use.
